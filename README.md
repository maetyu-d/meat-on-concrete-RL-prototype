Built in JS, Meat on Concrete is a prototype, Brutalist-inspired (fairly) traditional roguelike with a twist, namely that the player can dig through complex strata in order to unearth (relatively) fresh bodies, find relics, explore burried cathederals, underground necropoleis, etc. Oh and you can dismember these bodies and add parts of them to your own (for example to change or improve capabililties)... but must leave something behind in return.
